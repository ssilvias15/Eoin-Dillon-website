                  <h1>Eoin Dillon</h1>
                  <p>Dublin uilleann piper &Kíla founding member EOIN DILLON released his third solo album 
                      ‘PONDELORUM’ on September 26th followed by an album launch show in Whelans on Sunday 
                      October 2nd.  He shares ‘Dancing on the radio/Port Con Durham’ which is the opening track 
                      on the album. ‘Pondelorum’ is his third solo album having released his debut solo recording 
                      ‘The Third Twin’ in 2005 (named one of the best traditional albums of the year by 
                      RTE Radio One)followed by 2010’s ‘The Golden Mean’. 
                      Eoin has been playing the pipes and whistles since the age of 15.  
                      As a founding member of KÍLA he released 11 albums and toured the world with 
                      performances at top festivals including Glastonbury, Womad (Aus/NZ) and Montreux 
                      Jazz Festival.  As a solo artist, Eoin has guested with U2, BaabaMaal, Sinead O Connor, 
                      DonalLunny& Jane Sibery.  He composed the music with Kíla for 2 Oscar winning animation 
                      films in 2012/2015 - while his solo compositional work on ‘Ireland’s Wild River’ 
                      was nominated in the Best Music category at the 2015 Emmy Awards.

                      Over ten new compositions, ‘Pondelorum’ captures Eoin’s characterful, blistering and 
                      playful performance in full flight and showcases his innate skill as “a composer of first 
                      class tunes” (Irish Music Magazine).  As for the theme of the album Eoinsays 
                      “I'm not sure if there is a theme that I can put my finger on.  I tried to record a 
                      few times but couldn’t or it wasn’t working, but when I began writing wee stories 
                      it seemed to give me the start I needed.  It was a very enjoyable experience - we took our 
                      time and people just seemed to fit in.  For me, if I can put it into words, the album is a 
                      moment in time, a celebration of people and our history and the road we have travelled.”

                     ‘Pondelorum’ features input from a host of musical collaborators including 
                     Mícheál Ó Súilleabháinon harpsichord, Brian Hogan on bass and Graham Watson on 
                     guitars & mandolin.  The album was recorded in stages – initial recordings took 
                     place in Ó Súilleabháin’s home in Tipperary, the piano was recorded in the Unitarian 
                     Church on Stephens Green with the rest taking shape in Watson’s Floodplain Studio, Clontarf. 
                     The album is available from Claddagh Records &Spindizzy and online stores.
